## Content Breakdown:
- Lab 1: Simple lab that was mostly given to us. We learned about memory addresses using LC3. We manually typed hex data and it would load onto the screen. The lab also introduced output and loading data into registers. 
- Lab 2: This lab focuses on us memorizing basics of Assembly, such as branching, registers, instructions, and more specifically load/store instructions. It consists of 4 parts we coded from scratch:
    - Exponent: Calculate x^y = z, only using ADD instruction. It's set to calculate 3^4 currently.
    - For: Loop 10 amount of times adding 5 to a sum.
    - If Else: Trying out IF-ELSE statements in Assembly.
    - Array: Load user inputted numbers into an array.
- Lab 3: Code a calculator. Everything works except display. At the time I could not solve it. Now I just need to go back and fix it.
- Factorial: Example project professor provided. It is a runtime stack of a Factorial problem. Useful to see how stack frames worked.
- Lab 4: First runtime stack problem. Calculates sum of squares of a array.
- Lab 5: Another runtime stack problem. Calculates Fibonacci Sequence of a given number.
- 7-Checker: Code that checks if user input is equal to, greater than, or less than 7.
